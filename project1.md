### If it is green and running, you've done everything right
**Kudus to you! You have just launched your first Web Server in the Cloud!**

### Before you can receive any traffic on your Web Server, you need make sure your security group settings on AWS allows TCP port 80 traffic (HTTP).

### You can try to check if it is locally running on your Ubuntu terminal using the follwing commands

`curl http://localhost:80` **(Acccessing through DNS)**

`curl http://127.0.0.1:80` **(Accessing through the IP address)**

###  Next step to take is to test how your Apache HTTP server can respond to requests from the Internet.

### Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url

`http://<Public-IP-Address>` **(Public Address example: 55.11.22.226)**

### Kindly check your AWS console to get your public IP address

### If you see the following page, your web server has been properly installed and is now accessible through your firewall.
